# Chat Application

This is a simple chat application built using Python's 

socket and threading modules. It consists of a server and a client that allow multiple users to communicate with each other in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- ï»¿sockets==1.0.0

## Usage

### Running the Server

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `chat_server.py`.
3. Run the server script:
   ```sh
   python chat_server.py
   ```

### Running the Client

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `chat_client.py`.
3. Run the client script:
   ```sh
   python chat_client.py
   ```
4. Enter your username when prompted.
5. Start chatting! Type 'exit' to leave the chat.

: Sends a message to all clients except the sender.
  - 

handle_client(client_socket, username)

: Handles communication with a connected client.
  - 

start_server()

: Starts the chat server and listens for incoming connections.
  - `stop_server()`: Stops the chat server gracefully.

### Client (`chat_client.py`)

- **Global Variables**:
  -
